# cortex-discord-2
A Discord bot to support playing the Cortex Prime RPG, using Discord slash commands.

## Contact the Developer
My Discord handle is Don#2462, and my Twitter handle is @dbisdorf. Feel free to contact me with any bug reports, or, if you prefer, you can file them here on GitHub.

## Inviting the Bot
I have a public instance of this bot running 24/7. I can't guarantee it will be up 100% of the time; bugs or other issues may cause the bot to go down unexpectedly and to stay down for an indeterminate duration. You can invite this bot to your Discord server by giving this URL to your browser: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=697790419035226112&permissions=10240&scope=bot%20applications.commands

If you're setting up your own instance of CortexPal2000 through the Discord developer's portal, the bot requires the "bot" and "application.commands" scopes, and the "send messages" and "manage messages" permissions.

## Usage
This bot uses Discord's slash commands.

## Abandoned Games
If no one updates any game information in a given channel for a while, the bot will delete all game information in that channel. The clean-up time period is configurable.
